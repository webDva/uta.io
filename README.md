A web-based music player in early development.

Was going to keep it closed source, but this'll work.

# Intentions

I want to build a free online music player service and then iterate on it by allowing music makers to share or distribute their songs. This aspiration will take a *long* time to come to fruition, but I got time even if I have little runway.
